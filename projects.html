    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Here are of some of my past projects.</p>

    <h2>Arduino Circuits</h2>

    <p>I built several circuits using the arduino, an LED, a resistor, some switches, and several wires for fun.</p>

    <h2>CIV102 Bridge</h2>

    <p>I built a bridge out of Matboard and Contact Cement for my CIV102 course.</p>

    <h2>Ursa</h2>
    <img src="images/ursa.jpg" alt="FIRST Robotics Competition robot" width="400" height="600">

    <p>Ursa was a robust robot built for the FIRST Robotics Competition Crescendo Challenge. As Co-Captain of my team, I led the process of robot-build including strategical design, wiring, wire management, and troubleshooting. With Ursa, we qualified for District Championships and were Alliance Captains at the Windsor Competition.</p>

    <h2>Koda</h2>
    <img src="images/koda.jpg" alt="FIRST Robotics Competition robot" width="400" height="600">

    <p>Koda was a robot built for the FIRST Robotics Competition Charged Up Challenge. Through this build process, I learned how to approach iteration. Our claw broke 6 times throughout the season, but we kept building very similar iterations. If we had tried to pivot to a new design, as long as we prototyped, we likely would have been able to build a more reliable claw.</p>

    <h2>Sapphire</h2>

    <p>In 2022 at SHAD University of Prince Edward Island, our team developed a prototype and a pitch for Sapphire, a sexual education website to address the wellbeing of Canadian teens for our design project.</p>

    <h2>Callisto</h2>
    <img src="images/callisto.jpg" alt="FIRST Robotics Competition robot" width="400" height="600">

    <p>Callisto was the first ever robot I ever worked on, and was built for the FIRST Robotics Competition Rapid React Challenge. As Electrical Lead I led the wiring process of the control system. With Callisto, we qualified for District Championships and World Championships in Houston, TX.</p>
